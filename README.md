# AWS CI/CD Deployment with GitHub Actions

## 1. Login to AWS Console:

Access your AWS account and log in to the AWS Management Console.

## 2. Create IAM User for Deployment:

Create an IAM user in AWS with specific access permissions, including EC2 and ECR.

- EC2 Access: This provides access to virtual machines.
- ECR: Elastic Container Registry, used to store Docker images in AWS.

## 3. Create ECR Repository:

Create an Elastic Container Registry repository to store and manage Docker images. Save the repository URI for later use.

## 4. Create an EC2 Machine:

Set up an EC2 instance with the Ubuntu operating system.

## 5. Install Docker on the EC2 Machine:

Optionally, update and upgrade the EC2 instance and install Docker to manage containers.

```bash
# Optional
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Required
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```

## 6. Configure EC2 as Self-Hosted Runner:

Configure the EC2 instance as a self-hosted runner for GitHub Actions. This is done by following the settings in the GitHub repository under "Actions."

## 7. Setup GitHub Secrets:

In the GitHub repository settings, set up secrets for AWS credentials, ECR URI, and other necessary information.

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key.
- `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
- `AWS_ECR_LOGIN_URI`: The ECR login URI.(Part before the '/')
- `ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME`: The name of your ECR repository.(Part after the '/')
